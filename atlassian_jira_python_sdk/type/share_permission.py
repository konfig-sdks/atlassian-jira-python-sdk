It is used in requests, where it needs to be specify with `projectId` and `projectRoleId`.  *  `global` Shared globally. If set in a request, no other `sharePermission` properties need to be specified.  *  `loggedin` Shared with all logged-in users. Note: This value is set in a request by specifying `authenticated` as the `type`.  *  `project-unknown` Shared with a project that the user does not have access to. Cannot be set in a request.
